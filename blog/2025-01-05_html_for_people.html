                So, I finally decided to do something with my SDF website. 
                This started with an email from mom asking me for details about Tilly's graduation. 
                Jennie mentioned that we should send out invitations, and I decided that  it would 
                be a good idea to make a website for her graduation announcement. I had recently 
                seen a Mastodon post about the old-school beauty of hand-crafted websites, and 
                linked to the <a href="htmlforpeople.com">HTML for People</a> web-book. Since my 
                skill writing HTML by hand is still pretty novice, I decided to follow along with
                the book setting up my site.
            </p>

                This is still rather rough. I plan to continue to update it in my free time 
                over the next few weeks. The blog will journal my experiences setting up the 
                site, as well as other random things I want to write about.
