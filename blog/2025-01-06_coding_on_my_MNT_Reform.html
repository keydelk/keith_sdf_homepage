      <h2>My MNT Reform Laptop</h2>
	    <p>
	      So a few years ago, when I wanted to really learn how a computer works 
        from the ground up, a got an 
        <a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform">MNT Reform</a> laptop.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        I really like the machine, particularly the radically open nature of the product. 
        Not only does it use all open-source software, they publish schematics and even 
        cad files if you want to 3d print replacement parts. However, the tradeoff for 
        this openness is that the machine isn't exactly a powerhouse. The i.MX8M 
        processor module in my version gets the job done for most of my needs, 
        but the 4 ARM cores running at only 1.5 GHz doesn't exactly have cutting edge 
        performance. For this reason, the first version of the handbook recommended 
        against running heavier applications, including electron-based software 
        (such as VS Code). For that reason, I had mostly been learning to use other 
        editors (such as Emacs) for coding on the machine.
      </p>
      <h3>Emacs mess</h3>
      <p>
        For Python coding, I discovered I really liked the Emacs editor with they Elpy 
        package (from this tutorial: 
        <a href="https://realpython.com/emacs-the-best-python-editor/">Emacs: The Best Python Editor?</a> 
        ). So, I thought that I would do the same for editing my website. So I did 
        a quick Duck-Duck-Go search for configuring Emacs for web development. 
        I found quite a few tutorials, so I picked one that looked good and 
        tried to follow along. The one I picked was <a href="https://www.ovistoica.com/blog/2024-7-05-modern-emacs-typescript-web-tsx-config">
          Modern Emacs Typescript Web (React) Config with lsp-mode, treesitter, tailwind, TSX & more.
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        So, maybe I bit off a bit more than I could chew, because I spent over an hour 
        trying to configure emacs with these packages (and learning what lsp-mode is and
        what an lsp server is), and gave up when emacs kept throwing errors.
      </p>
      <h3>Trying VSCodium on my Reform</h3>
      <p>
        Wanting to keep my Reform as FOSS pure as possible, I decided to install 
        <a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a> instead of VS Code. I was able to 
        install following the instructions for Debian. The first time opening the 
        program was a bit slow, and adding extentions isn't exacly fun on this machine. 
        Still, it runs well enough that it doesn't really slow me down.
