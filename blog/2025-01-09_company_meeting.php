       <h2>My Introversion Gets More Pronounced as I get Older</h2>
       <p>
        No post yesterday, as I was dead tired by the time I got home and went 
        to be immediately after dinner. We had our annual company meeting, which 
        means that instead of normal work, we have a full day of all company 
        meetings followed by a highly encouraged company happy hour. I don't 
        particularly mind company social events, I'm lucky to have pretty good 
        coworkers who I like working with. But I'm definitely more of an introvert, 
        and hours of social interaction leave me feeling pretty drained.
       </p>
       <h2>Big Projects Ahead</h2>
       <p>
        I can't go into too much detail, as blog posts are public (even if almost nobody 
        reads it), and the company hasn't publicly announced these upcoming features. 
        But it sounds like my team is going to be working on a very prominent, user-facing 
        feature. We've done similar projects before, but after months of minor enhancements,
        bug fixes, and backend work like new APIs, I'm feeling a bit nervous about picking 
        up such a big, user-facing feature.
       </p>
       <p>
        I work as the Business Analyst on the team, so my responsibilities center 
        around requirements gathering, some design work, writing user-stories in 
        Jira, and some project-management type work. This upcoming feature is 
        going to be a good test of my abilities.
