				Inspired by <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com/">HTML for People</a>. 
				This site is my little home on the internet. It will contain pages for
				whatever purposes that I need at the time. My plan is to code this entirely
				by hand. I also am avoiding any cookies or trackers that are ubiquitous
				in the modern web.
			</p>
			<p>
			  This site is a work in progress. For now:
			</p>
			<ul>
			  <li><a href="/blog/">Check out my Blog</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Update to PHP</h2>
			<p>
				At this point, I'm updating the page to use PHP to make the nav 
				section easier to maintain and to automatically update the date.
