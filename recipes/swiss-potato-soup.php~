      Valentine's Day Recipe From Roberta Keydel.
      Old Fashioned Swiss Potato Sausage Soup.
      This delicious soup from my childhood came from my father's family in 
      Highland, Illinois, a region also called New Switzerland. It's simple farm
      fare from the Old World. I found this recipe in a collection from my Aunt
      Jennie Latzer Kaesar's recipes that the family printed for her in 1978 in
      honor of her 100th birthday.
      Aunt Jennie lived in Highland her entire life and was the keeper of the
      local history. In 1970, when she was 92, she completed and published
      'The Settling of Highland,' a translation of the letters of the founders 
      of New Switzerland. An abridged version of one such letter is on the back.
      Handwritten:
      This was my valentine to the Valentine's Day party at Newbury Court.
      Thought you would be interested in the quote from Aunt Jane Kaesar.
      Have a Happy Valentine's Day">
